**CODE DESCRIPTION**
This code is like saving a new password of an account of a user. It evaluates first if the given passsword is the same and if it has at lesat one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and a number. If it satisifes the said conditions, the password of the user will be permanently replacecd, while if not, it will maitain the previous password of te user.

**What are your key takeaways from this exercise?**
This is not the first time i used javascript as a language, however, i still sometimes look at the module frequently in order to check if im doing the right thing or whenever i dont know what to do. One of my major takeaways for this exercise is that, in order for you to really somehow be familiarized with a certain language, you really need to make constant effort by pacrticing codes of that language. For me, the last time I tried this language was already more than a year ago already, and because of that, I became dormant that led to also ahve a dormant mind. That's why starting from now, Ill try to code the languages I already learned every time I have the opportunity to do so.
